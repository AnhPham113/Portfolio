                                    KiddiMath is a mental math center for
                                    children aged 4–12. The center’s practice
                                    app helps students reinforce what they’ve
                                    learned and build fluency through
                                    teacher-guided exercises — before, during,
                                    or after class.

                                    To make the app more effective, I focused on
                                    students it wasn’t fully supporting — like
                                    those falling behind or needing extra time
                                    to finish a course. I wanted to shift how
                                    they approached practice: from something
                                    they were told to do, to something they were
                                    motivated to complete. Linking practice
                                    actions to visible goals became the core
                                    design focus that drove this transformation.

                                        students practice: the textbook, extra

                                        — currently only supports the grouped

                                        really use the app to practice right

                                        learning flow. In each sub-level,
                                        students typically learn small formulas
                                        first, then practice a big grouped
                                        formula that combines what they’ve just
                                        studied. But the app only provided
                                        grouped exercises — there were no drills
                                        for the smaller parts.

                                        This meant students couldn’t start using
                                        the app until they had learned all the
                                        formulas in the group, even though they
                                        might’ve been ready to practice parts of
                                        it earlier.

                                        alongside the big grouped ones — making
                                        it easier to use during the actual
                                        learning process, not just after it.

                                        When we added small-step formulas into
                                        the app, it technically filled a gap:
                                        now students could review both
                                        individual and grouped concepts
                                        digitally, not just on paper. From the
                                        center’s perspective, that meant the app
                                        was more complete — a better teaching
                                        tool.

                                        didn’t change much. I had seen this
                                        firsthand as a former teacher: even when
                                        we replaced paper homework with
                                        app-based drills, many kids still
                                        skipped it. To them, it was still just
                                        “more homework.” They were already doing
                                        so much at school — this didn’t feel
                                        different.

                                        — not just feel like they had to.
                                        Connecting practice to visible,
                                        motivating rewards was key to that

                                        early-stage practice for students. I
                                        shared this with the teachers to see if
                                        the problem resonated with them — and
                                        they agreed it made sense..

                                        My second assumption was that adding
                                        single-formula drills early on could
                                        help — but only if kids actually wanted
                                        to use them. I knew more content alone
                                        wouldn’t engage them, so I needed to
                                        find a way to make it feel rewarding.
                                        But I wasn’t sure what that would look
                                        like — so I started asking.

                                        From the interviews, I learned two
                                        things. First, many students already
                                        felt overwhelmed from schoolwork. More
                                        drills — even simplified ones — could
                                        make them feel worse if they kept
                                        getting things wrong. Second, teachers
                                        were concerned about turning the app
                                        into something too game-like, fearing it
                                        would distract kids from real-life
                                        classroom activities.

                                        That’s when I reframed the approach:
                                        instead of focusing on accuracy, I
                                        focused on accumulated progress. One
                                        correct answer wasn’t “1 out of 10” — it
                                        was a step forward -a small win, getting
                                        the student closer to a reward (like a
                                        badge or a higher position in the
                                        rankings). This new way of framing
                                        helped students feel motivated without
                                        pressure, while still meeting teachers’
                                        expectations for a non-game-focused app.

                                        explanation the first time, especially
                                        for younger kids. I noticed that several
                                        less important buttons were given equal
                                        visual weight as the essential ones,

                                            To decide how single formulas should
                                            be separated from grouped ones, I
                                            worked closely with the center owner

                                            were defined, I came up with names

                                            became “planting a tree,” and
                                            completing a grouped exercise —
                                            which includes all those single
                                            formulas — became “harvesting.” This
                                            playful analogy made it easier for
                                            everyone to visualize the learning

                                        To make the “Try” step more noticeable,
                                        I updated the flow so that when a
                                        student starts a session, a confirmation
                                        modal appears asking whether they want
                                        to Try or Practice. Choosing Try gives 1
                                        question to get familiar with the
                                        format, while Practice follows the
                                        number of questions they’ve set.

                                            Each practice formula is built from
                                            three factors — Digit (D), Row (R),
                                            and Time (S) — with stars assigned
                                            to each. Kids need to adjust the
                                            difficulty so that all required
                                            stars light up. Only then will their

                                            and rankings. This not only

                                        is not just about coding the UI—it also

                                        I realized that not every design detail
                                        in Figma can or should be implemented
                                        directly in code. While it’s easy to
                                        design freely, performance must also be
                                        considered to ensure the app runs
                                        smoothly. For example, I initially added
                                        a shadowed countdown bar in the exercise
                                        screen. However, this design was later
                                        removed during development because they
                                        caused performance issues like lagging.
                                        This taught me the importance of
                                        balancing creativity with feasibility
                                        right from the design stage.
